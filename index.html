      <h1>Mary had a little lamb</h1>

      <p>
        Mary had a little lamb, Its fleece was white as snow; And everywhere
        that Mary went The lamb was sure to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        It followed her to school one day, Which was against the rule; It made
        the children laugh and play To see a lamb at school.
      </p>

      <p>
        And so the teacher turned it out, But still it lingered near, And waited
        patiently about Till Mary did appear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Why does the lamb love Mary so? The eager children cry; Why, Mary loves
        the lamb, you know, The teacher did reply.
      </p>
